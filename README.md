# Alignment-free Sequence Comparision
This project was one my bioinformatics projects I did as a student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb. The project was inspired by a paper published in 2017 (Zielezinski et al., Alignment-free sequence comparision: benefits, applications, and tools) where alignment-free sequence analysis methods are discussed.
